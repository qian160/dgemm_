    from the book 《Computer Organization And Design 》
Some ideas on the book seems to be wrong, here's my idea

I strongly believe it must be B * A rather than A * B!!!! And the comment of the matrix index in the book also fails

Let's first consider the question: What are the datas that will affect the value of cij?
The answer is easy: all the datas in the row i of A and the column j of B

Take b11 as an further observation.
Since `b11` will affect both c11 c12 c13 c14..., we could copy it 4 times as a pack and multiply it to a11, a12, a13, a14 them all at one time
(that's why __mm256_broadcast_sd is applied to b,which also indicates why it should be B * A)

we use the rule of row combination for calculation: row k of C is equal to some row combinations of B

          K ---->		     I  ---->			 I  ---->
   J	| b11 b12 b13  |        K   | a11 a12 a13 |         J	|b11 * row1 of A + b12 * row2 of A + b13 * row 3 of A |
   |	| b21 b22 b23  |    *   |   | a21 a22 a23 |	=   |	|...						      |
   V	| b31 b32 b33  |        V   | a31 a32 a33 |  	    V	|...		  				      |		
	       B		   	   A                       			 C
	     K + NJ		       I + 4X + NK				    I + 4X + NJ
	  
These are the datas that will be used during a K-loop:

	 BBBB   -------------------------- ----------------------------------------> 	 
	 \   /				  |					   |
	  \ / 				  |					  c1   c2   c3   c4   
	  |B B B B ...	|		|AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA	...	|	|CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC ...	|	c on these location will be affected in this loop
	  |		|		|				|	|		    		|
	  |		|		|				|	|		    		|
	 	 B				A			  			C
After K++:
	   BBBB
 	   \  /
 	    \/
	  |B B B B ...  |		|			...	|	|CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC ...	|	we are still working on the same cs, since b is still on the old row
	  |             |		|AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA    ...	|	|				|	
	  |             |	 	|				|	|		    		|
	 	 B				A			  			C
